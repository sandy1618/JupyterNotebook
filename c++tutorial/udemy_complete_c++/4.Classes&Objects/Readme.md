# Object OOP concets 
> Abstraction
> Encapsulaiton
> Inheritance
> Polymorphism

## Abstraction
> In c++ represented through, Class, struct, interface , union and enum 

## Encapsulation 
> Next step after abstraction 
> hides the implementation details to reduce complexity
> Imporemeted through Access modifiers in OO languages 

## Inheritance 
> parent child behavior inheritences 
> "is-a " relationship of objects 
> eg: dog is a animal

## Composition
> Makes relationship between objects 
> "has-a" or "part-of" relationship
> Promotes reuse of objects 
> eg: car has engine

## Polymorhism
> means different forms
> represents common behavior with different implementation
> response will be different for each object, either based on its class or arguments 
> eg . car, cycle,person has common behavior move but how they move is different. 
> Implemented through function
>   compile-time: overloading, templates 
>   run-time:     virtual functions
> Used in conjuction with inheritance & composition
> promotes: resuse , scalability & extensibility
